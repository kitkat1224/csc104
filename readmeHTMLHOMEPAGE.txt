This is the base set up in html that I will use to build my website's home page. So far the contents displayed are:

-nav bar
-logo on the side of the sidebar
-banner image 
-Headers in content listing the about me, services, and work history 
-banner image breaking up the sections
-cards to display different portfolios and their respective buttons
-footer at the bottom of page that is fixed
